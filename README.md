Repository for the Udacity Robot Arm Project 
# Navigation Project Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree 

## Project

This projects trains an actor critic agent to move a robot arm to target locations.  



## Setup Instructions

### Python 

Setup your Python Enviornment according to the instructions by [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies) (as shown below). This will install important frameworks like PyTorch and the ML-Agents toolkit.   

## Dependencies

To set up your python environment to run the code in this repository, follow the instructions below.

1. Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6.

	- __Linux__ or __Mac__:

	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6
	source activate drlnd
	```
	- __Windows__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6 
	activate drlnd
	```
